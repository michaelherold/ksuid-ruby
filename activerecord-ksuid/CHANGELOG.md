## 1.0.0 - Unreleased

### Added

- Extracted the ActiveRecord behavior from [`ksuid-v0.5.0`](https://github.com/michaelherold/ksuid-ruby/tree/v0.5.0) into its own gem to slim down the gem and remove unnecessary functionality for people who only want the KSUID functionality.

### Fixed

- Binary KSUIDs on PostgreSQL now correctly deserialize without any extra configuration.
